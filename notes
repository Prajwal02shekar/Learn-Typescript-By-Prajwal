***Note***

1. all javascript code can be written in typescript

2. all the code in typescript cannot be written in javascript


---> Typescript types----
it provides the strongly typed language to the javascript with the help of typescript

2types 

1. Type annotation
2. Type inference


Type annotation
--> explicitly we are specifing the datatype 


synatx for type annotation

let username:[type]


Type inference
--> implicitly tsc will specify the datatype


Datatypes in Typescript
 1.Primitive Datatypes
    a.string
    b.number
    c.boolean
    d.null
    e.undefined
 2.Object Reference Datatypes || Non Primitive Datatypes
    a.Object
    b.function
    c.array


//TUPLES
 tuples are like advanced array with extra feature that ensure type safety in typescript

 Note:
 --> no restrictions for array methods in tuples
 --> if it is a tuple we need to follow the fixed size array

 typesafety --> helps in error handling

 Difference between tuple and array
  tuple-->when we assign values to a tuple ,these values must match the types

  array--> it takes the multiple type when it is declared any type.


//? Type Union
an ability to combine one or more different types of data.
it is the most powerful way to express a variable with multiple types
use("|")--->pipe symbol


// type alias
 type alias gives a new name, they are similar to interface

 NOTE:
 alias doesen't truely create a new type insted of it gives that type a new name.
